# javascript-raytracing
Small raytracing example in p5.js. Just open index.html in a web browser. The little dot shoots rays out in a cone around the mouse pointer. FOV, in this case the amount of rays, can be changed with the slider in the bottom left. Up arrow and down arrow can be used to move forward and backward.

Designed and created to explain how raytracing works to those unfamiliar with computer graphics.. Describes how distance can be calculated and how that distance can be used to create a depth and deepness effect.

Hackathon project.
